# mayaTools
Hello there!
This repo contains some of the scripts and tools I write as I rig personal projects. Some of them are more reuseable than others, but hopefully they give a glimpse into how I code to speed up my workflow in Maya.

### Abbreviations
I try to use common rigging abbreviations where possible, but here's a quick key just in case:
- ctl: Control/Controller (NURBS Curves for animators to select)
- jnt: Joint
- loc: Locator
- grp: Group
